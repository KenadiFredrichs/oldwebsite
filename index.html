        My Favorite Movie
    </H2>

    <P>
        My favoite movie is called <b>A Silent Voice. </b>
        The reason why its my favorite movie is because it is an animation movie. 
        Those, in my opinion, are rare to come by. 
        It has so much deep meanings and it has such good art syle.

       My Favotite Type of Music
    </H3>

    <p>
        The music that I most enjoy is <b> punk rock </b>. 
        Its not too much rock and has that little bit of pop/punk music which makes it sound so cool.

        My Favorite Dog Breed
    </H4>

    <P>
        Even though I have two german shepherds they aren't my favorite dog breed. 
        They may be second on my list but my number one spot has got to be <b>corgi's</b>.
        They are so small and it doesn't matter what color they are because they look cute either way.

        My Favorite Color
    </H5>

    <P>
        My colors are important to me but if I had to pick one to be my favoite it has to be <B>Orange</B>.
        It isn't a basic color that people use all the time.
        Plus I think the color is cool and can bevery vibrant if it wants.

        My Favorite Candy
    </H6>

    <P>
        Theres a lot of candy that people like, but I really like the most basic candy in the world. 
        Of course I like other candies apart from it but I would just pick this over any candy.
        My favorite candy would have to be a <B>milk chocolate candy bar</B>.
